===========

an experiment in using HTML5 based tools for viewing a slideshow-like series of images with annotations

result should be a simple, downloadable tool for learning pathologic entities, with sufficiently numerous examples

Navigation should be keyboard or screen based, images should be appropriately sized to fit the screen (zoom function?)

Ideal implementation should using a cache to ensure that images cycle seamlessly

Annotations should proceed in levels. First the image appears, then diagnosis, then added text and explaination.
